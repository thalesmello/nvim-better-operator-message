# Neovim Better Operator Message

Aims to replace Vim's default "10 lines yanked" with a more meaningful "10
lines yanked into register c", when used together with a register.

Requires Neovim, as it relies on
[TextYankPost](https://neovim.io/doc/user/autocmd.html#TextYankPost) to work.

This plugin was inspired by a [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46413844/print-information-about-register-used-in-vim-report).
